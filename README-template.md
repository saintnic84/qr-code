## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

What I learned was that even with knowing the syntax of CSS, you still need to test and practice with the box model in order to get the correct position. 


```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```



### Continued development

I'm going to focus on how to effectively use frameworks, so that I don't need to spend unnecessary time coding from scratch


### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer Network](https://www.example.com) - This helped me quickly find the properties I needed for
